# Tindog

Landing page of a fictional company, that aims to find the perfect partner for your dog.

My very first solo web development project inspired by The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp.

## Technologies

This simple site didn't require much technology so I used only the core basics.

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Basic JavaScript

## What I learned

This project was aimed at putting my already aquired skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to use. I learned how to work with the basic elements of the language and how to structure my code.

## Biggest obstacle

The hardest part of this project was setting up media queries and making the mobile navigation.
