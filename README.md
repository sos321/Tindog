# Tindog

My very first web development project.

This is a website created while taking part in The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp

Firstly I created a Figma wireframe and a high-fidelity mockup. Then I got the coding itself.

Technologies used: (My first project)
- HTML
- CSS
- Google
- Visual Studio Code
